# SmartCart Canada Architecture

## Purpose

SmartCart Canada is a privacy-first, community-powered grocery price platform.

The mobile app helps shoppers scan products, build carts, compare prices, and eventually upload receipts so grocery prices can be updated automatically without requiring manual entry.
